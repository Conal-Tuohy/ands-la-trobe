# ANDS La Trobe projects

This github site relates to two data management projects run by La Trobe University, from Melbourne Australia, and funded by the Australian National Data Service.

The projects aim to support researchers in managing research data, by providing a system for describing and contextualising their data, and publishing it through a portal and also through the ANDS Research Data Commons.

The two projects are:

| Code name                   | Details                                                       |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|Data Capture 19 (DC19)	      | The instrumental facility at the La Trobe Centre for Materials and Surface Science facility (CMSS)|
|Seeding the Commons 18 (SC18)|	The Australian Historical Archaeology Database|

The project's software design is component-oriented, and hence much of the code written for the project is "glue" or "orchestration" code.
