#summary Installation of the Digital Archaeological Record
=tDAR Install=

tDAR is a Java app, built with Maven. To install Maven using yum I added the jpackage repository to the list of yum repositories, as specified here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6298865/how-to-install-maven-into-red-hat-linux-enterprise-addition-6

{{{
yum update
yum install maven2
}}}

Followed instructions at: http://dev.tdar.org/confluence/display/TDAR/deploying+tDAR up to and including the step of running the maven build.

(When renaming the .production files, I moved any files which would have been overwritten into a "backup" folder).
