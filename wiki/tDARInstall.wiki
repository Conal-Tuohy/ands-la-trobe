#summary Installation of the Digital Archaeological Record
=tDAR Install=

Source code. Adam Brin provided a tarball of the `src` folder of the `eolian` branch, but didn't include the pom.xml (Maven build file), so I downloaded it separately from their repository:
{{{
wget http://dev.tdar.org/fisheye/browse/~raw,r=2432/tDAR/branches/eolian/pom.xml
}}}

tDAR is a Java app, built with Maven. To install Maven using yum I added the jpackage repository to the list of yum repositories, as specified here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6298865/how-to-install-maven-into-red-hat-linux-enterprise-addition-6

{{{
yum update
yum install maven2
}}}

Followed instructions at: http://dev.tdar.org/confluence/display/TDAR/deploying+tDAR up to and including the step of running the Maven build.

(When renaming the .production files, I moved any files which would have been overwritten into a "backup" folder).

Got build error from Maven:

{{{
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ERROR] BUILD ERROR
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Error resolving version for 'org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-javadoc-plugin': Plugin requires Maven version 2.0.9
}}}

So we seem to need a newer version of Maven. :-(
