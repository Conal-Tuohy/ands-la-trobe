#summary Installation of the Digital Archaeological Record
=tDAR Install=

Source code. Adam Brin provided a tarball of the `src` folder of the `eolian` branch, but didn't include the pom.xml (Maven build file), so I downloaded it separately from their repository:
{{{
wget http://dev.tdar.org/fisheye/browse/~raw,r=2432/tDAR/branches/eolian/pom.xml
}}}

tDAR is a Java app, built with Maven. 

Installed Maven from download. - Details: Daniel?

Followed instructions at: http://dev.tdar.org/confluence/display/TDAR/deploying+tDAR up to and including the step of running the Maven build.

(When renaming the .production files, I moved any files which would have been overwritten into a "backup" folder).

==Crowd==
tDAR uses Atlassian "Crowd" for authentication:
