#summary Installation of the Digital Archaeological Record
=tDAR Install=

Source code. Adam Brin provided a tarball of the `src` folder of the `eolian` branch, but didn't include the pom.xml (Maven build file), so I downloaded it separately from their repository:
{{{
wget http://dev.tdar.org/fisheye/browse/~raw,r=2432/tDAR/branches/eolian/pom.xml
}}}

tDAR is a Java app, built with Maven. 

==Maven==

Yum appears (as of 12/7/11) to only have an ancient build of Maven available (2.0.8), and this is earlier than the minimun required version.

Downloaded Maven 2.2.1 from http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/maven/binaries/apache-maven-2.2.1-bin.tar.gz and installed manually (ln -s /bin -> usr/bin, /lib -> /var/lib/, etc).

Followed instructions at: http://dev.tdar.org/confluence/display/TDAR/deploying+tDAR up to and including the step of running the Maven build.

(When renaming the .production files, I moved any files which would have been overwritten into a "backup" folder).

==Crowd==
tDAR uses Atlassian "Crowd" for authentication:

The Crowd groups which tDAR expects are defined in an enum here:
