#summary Directions on installing the custom XForms used in DC19
#labels DC19

= Introduction = 

XForms are used in DC19 to give end users a nicer and quicker interface to work with than xml editing in the fedora admin application. They also provide a mechanism for validating some content.

= Details =

The XForms system relies on an XSLT interpreter. For the purposes of this project we used XSLTForms because of its stability across most browser platforms (application/xhtml+xml mime type is normally required, but text/xml can be used as a substitute in the case of IE, et al).

The XForms we created for the project are specific to the schema detailed [http://code.google.com/p/ands-la-trobe/wiki/CMSSDescriptiveMetadata here], but can be used as a general guide for building an XForms system for metadata editing.

== Installation ==

Checkout the XForms tree from svn.
{{{
cd /home/fedora-user/
svn checkout https://ands-la-trobe.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/xforms
}}}

Add the following to /etc/httpd/conf.d/xforms.conf
{{{
# XForms are located in the /home/fedora-user/xforms folder

Alias /xforms /home/fedora-user/xforms

RewriteEngine on

# Rewrite requests for /fedora-objects/{item-pid}/datastreams/{datastream-name}.xhtml to
# point to the appropriate XForm editor, i.e. /xforms/{datastream-name}.xhtml
# The user agent will retrieve an XForm, and the XForm itself can then refer to the
# metadata stream using the relative URI "{datastream-name}". e.g. an XForm called
# "person.xhtml" will internally refer to the editable instance by the URI "person".
#
# XForm accessed as "/fedora-objects/{item-pid}/datastreams/{datastream-name}.xhtml"
# XForm internally retrieved from "/xforms/{datastream-name}.xhtml"
# Metadata instance accessed from "/fedora-objects/{item-pid}/datastreams/{datastream-name}

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /fedora-objects/(.*)/datastreams/(.*)\.xhtml
RewriteRule /fedora-objects/(.*)/datastreams/(.*)\.xhtml /xforms/$2.xhtml [P]


# To avoid problems with Safari (see <http://code.google.com/p/ands-la-trobe/issues/detail?id=68>),
# access to the XForms requires HTTP Basic authentication.
# There are two authentication providers here:
# 1) the VeRSI LDAP repository (which Fedora also uses), and failing that;
# 2) the /etc/httpd/.htpasswd file (which includes the same principals as /home/fedora-user/fedora/server/config/fedora-users.xml)

<Directory /home/fedora-user/xforms>
# Use HTTP Basic authentication
AuthType Basic

# authenticate against the LDAP repository first, and failing that, against the password file
AuthBasicProvider ldap file

# to see the form, a user must be known to one of the two authentication systems
Require valid-user

# Same authentication realm name as Fedora sends
AuthName "!!Fedora Repository Server"

# LDAP bind details
AuthLDAPURL ldap://128.250.148.11/?uid?sub
AuthLDAPBindDN cn=root,dc=versi,dc=edu,dc=au
AuthLDAPBindPassword v3rs1adm1n

# The password file location
AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/.htpasswd
</Directory>
}}}

Optionally, you can also alter the mimetype table (at /etc/mime.types) to make .xhtml files report as text/xml or alternatively use the following additional rewrite directives:

{{{
#To send .xhtml text/xml mimetype to IE 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} .*MSIE.*
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.xhtml$
RewriteRule .* - [T=text/xml]
}}}

Forms should now be used automatically from the fedora-objects/$objectName/datastreams/$type.xhtml, and will be directed there by the Edit link on the Solr results page.
