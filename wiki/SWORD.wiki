#summary Information on the installation of the SWORD package for Fedora

= Introduction =

SWORD is a submission tool that allows users to add objects to a fedora repository with relative ease. It currently only supports PUSH operations, but is still in development.


= Details =

  * Got SWORD package from  http://sword-app.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sword-app/fedora/ 
    * (wget http://sword-app.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sword-app/fedora/trunk.tar.gz?view=tar)
  * untar to /ands/files/SWORD-fedora-1.1/
  * modified config
    * conf/properties.xml
      * modified pid_namespace
      * modified all uri locations
        * repository_uri
        * deposit_uri
      * modified accepted data types
        * pending more info from conal. Sadly this must be done at compile at the moment.
  * ran ant dist, installed into Tomcat6

NB when reinstalling, it appears necessary to run:
`ant clean`
and also
`rm -r -f /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/sword`
before
`ant dist`
