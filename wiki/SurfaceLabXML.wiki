#summary Namespace document for the SurfaceLab XML produced by our SurfaceLab XML exporter

SurfaceLab6 is ION-TOF's TOF-SIMS control and analysis software suite, and consists of two separate packages with a common interface: FPanel control suite and Measurement Explorer. These packages populate a shared data structure with measurements, analytical data and metadata.

The SurfaceLabXML output given by our exporter script is currently in the following format:
{{{
<parameterName>StringValue</parameterName>
}}}

Note that SurfaceLab6 potentially stores every variable 3 times, each in a String, Real and Integer format. We currently only export the String value. It is (surprisingly) more accurate than the others: real is in truncated format with a short mantissa, int is (of course) only precise to whole integers, and any param that is primarily a string will store a value of 0 for both the real and int.

Because the params are dynamically populated based on available metadata for the current experiment, an exhaustive list is not available.
