#summary Details on removing all data from the CMSS system

== Fedora ==

Fedora stores data simultaneously in relational and filesystem databases. Both of these need to be cleared in order to purge the system of records.

The fedora applicaion should not be running when the procedure is carried out if you don't want to see hundreds of null pointer exceptions in your servlet handler logs.

=== Database ===

Issuing the following sequence of commands from with the DBMS will purge the database of records:

{{{
mysql -u fedora -p
use fedora3;
truncate datastreamPaths;
truncate dcDates;
truncate doFields;
truncate doRegistry;
truncate modelDeploymentMap;
truncate objectPaths;
truncate pidGen;
}}}

=== Disk ===

The following commands will purge the pairtree and objectStore.

{{{
cd $FEDORA_HOME/data
rm -rf activemq-data/*
rm -rf datastreamStore/*
rm -rf objectStore/*
}}}

If the resourceIndex is enabled, you should do the following to purge it:

{{{
cd $FEDORA_HOME/data
rm -rf resourceIndex/*
}}}

=== Solr ===

The following commands will clear the solr index of data:

{{{
cd $SOLR_HOME/data
rm -rf index/*

}}}

=== jOAI ===

The safest way to remove all data from the jOAI system is via the administration console, normally at /oai. From the Data Provider menu, select the Metadata Files Configuration page. Select 'Remove' for each listed directory and reindex to purge any remaining data.
