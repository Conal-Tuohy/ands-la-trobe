#summary Search Plugin for Fedora and solr/etc.

Need to install and configure it to index Fedora objects by selected properties of their "rif-cs" datastream so that we can search for registry objects by type and by name, and by key.

== Notes ==

  * Work done on this by Muradora team appears to be lost with the closure of the project.
  * sourceforge page does not list the 2.2 release, despite having it available for download (http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fedora-commons/genericsearch-2.2.zip)
 

== Deployment ==

  * placed fedoragsearch.war in /usr/share/tomcat6/webapps
    * autobuilt dir structure
  * added entry to reverse proxy list (/etc/httpd/conf.d/fedoragsearch.conf)

  * changed port numbers in configvalues.xml
    * changed all instances of 8080 to 80


== Configuration ==

  After installation, configuration details can be viewed at the deployment location (e.g andsdb-dc19-dev.latrobe.edu.au/fedoragsearch).

  

  * ran ant -f configvalues.xml configOnWebServer
    * Invalid tomcat path reported. Changed configvalues.xml:
      * changed {fedora.path}/tomcat to {env.CATALINA_PATH}, reran succesfully.
