#summary Notes about development of tDAR

=Filestore interface=

The storage interface (this is what we'd have to implement using Fedora):

http://dev.tdar.org/fisheye/browse/tDAR/trunk/src/main/java/org/tdar/filestore/Filestore.java?hb=true

How does it relate to the FilestoreService (which is supposed to provide access to a "Person" Filestore)?

http://dev.tdar.org/fisheye/browse/~br=trunk/tDAR/trunk/src/main/java/org/tdar/core/service/FilestoreService.java?r=2484

=Metadata schema=

The metadata schema used in tDAR is shown in this test case:

http://dev.tdar.org/fisheye/browse/tDAR/trunk/src/test/resources/xml/documentImport.xml?hb=true

http://dev.tdar.org/fisheye/browse/tDAR/trunk/src/test/java/org/tdar/struts/action/APIControllerITCase.java?hb=true

=Skin=

The main layout page of the tDAR app (which will need to be customised to brand AHAD): http://dev.tdar.org/fisheye/browse/tDAR/trunk/src/main/webapp/layout.dec?hb=true

This service shows a federated search over the ADS and tDAR repositories (at a granularity of projects, only, though). This apparently is built on a tDAR web service.
