#summary How data flows around the system

Data is ingested into Fedora using SWORD, edited using XForms, manipulated and cross-walked using XSLT transformations, and exported to an OAI-PMH server and a search engine.

The automated flow of data through the system is driven by a set of events. Fedora emits notifications of these events, and a set of event-handlers receive these notifications and perform processing in response.
