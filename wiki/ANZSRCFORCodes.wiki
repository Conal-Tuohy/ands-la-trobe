#summary ANZSRC Field of Research codes
#labels DC19

The now depleted ADFI still publishes a SKOS version of this vocabulary, but how does this relate to the codes required in RIF-CS? Doesn't RIF-CS just include the numeric code?

Also the ADFI-hosted vocabulary uses HTTP URIs which are broken (they return 404), which is not a great sign.
