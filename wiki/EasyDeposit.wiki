#summary Notes on the SWORD EasyDeposit tool

= Introduction =

EasyDeposit is an application for making custom SWORD interfaces. It is designed to be used with a variety of repository systems.

= Details =

 * got package from http://easydeposit.swordapp.org/

 * unzipped package to /var/www/easydeposit
 * modified easydeposit/application/config/config.php
   * $config[‘base_url’] = “http://andsdb-dc19-dev.etc/easydeposit”;

 Ran into some issues with the {{{RewriteRule}}} in .htaccess - it never fired. Added $config[‘index_page’] = 'index.php'; which uglifies the url, but resolves the issue.

Note that default Username/Password are easydepositadmin/easydepositadmin
