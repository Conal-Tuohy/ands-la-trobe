=XForms=

==plan==

  * install Mozilla xforms client - done
  * create (edit e.g. name only) basic rif-cs editor with a fixed resource in the fedora back-end - done
   * http://andsdb-dc19-dev.latrobe.edu.au/xforms/rif-cs.xhtml
  * develop editor into full rif-cs handler
   * all registryObject types
   * authority file lookups with autocomplete
  * deploy a transform to wrap the Fedora rif-cs resource in an xform
   * integrate XSLTForms or failing that, Orbeon

==Notes==

  * Firefox 4 does not play well with XSLTForms < build 499 due to xPath problems.
  * Internet Explorer does not implement the application/xhtml+xml mime type.
