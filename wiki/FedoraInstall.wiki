#summary Notes on the installation of Fedora Commons to Tomcat on andsdb-server

= Introduction =

A list of steps taken so far, and immediate requirements.


= Details =

 * got Fedora Commons jar installer 
  * ( fcrepo-installer-3.4.2.jar @ /home/ands-shared/ )
 * Need to add Envvars to tomcat (in this case, /etc/profile to share these envvars with all users.)
  * JAVA_HOME
  * FEDORA_HOME
  * PATH (add $FEDORA_HOME/server/bin, $FEDORA_HOME/client/bin and $JAVA_HOME/bin. )
  * CATALINA_HOME

 * modified mysql database -  why can't the installer handle this?
  * added fedora user
  * added fedora3 database
  * added authority database
  * modified permissions, etc

 * ran installer (./java -jar fcrepo-installer-3.4.2.jar)

 NOTE: Was missing /usr/share/tomcat6/common/lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.6.jar for JDBC connector. Located and added manually.

 ADDENDUM: Was ACTUALLY missing apache packages commons-dbcp-1.4 and commons-pool-1.5.5 as well. These should be placed in the same directory as the mysql-connector-java.jar and this path should be reported in the appropriate place when running the fcrepo installer.

 NOTE: target dir should be owned by the designated fedora user. Dir will be chmodded 766 by the installer.
