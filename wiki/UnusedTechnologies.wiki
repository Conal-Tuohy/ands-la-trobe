#summary Technologies we've looked at but aren't using in our projects

=Squire=

Squire is a user interface for depositing and editing object datastreams and metadata. It's a Java version of VALET, provided to the ARROW project as a contribution from VTLS.

In our system deposit/ingest is to be performed using a custom SWORD client talking to Fedora's SWORD server.

Metadata editing is to be done using a few custom XForms reading and writing XML data from Fedora's RESTful web service interface.
