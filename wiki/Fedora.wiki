#summary Notes about Fedora, especially interfaces

Fedora uses Apache ActiveMQ for messaging.

ActiveMQ supports a number of protocols including a supposedly "RESTful" HTTP interface that would be useable from XProc.


http://activemq.apache.org/rest.html

A bogus aspect of it is that the GET method is neither safe nor idempotent. So in fact it's not a REST interface at all.
