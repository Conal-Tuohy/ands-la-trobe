#summary Notes about Fedora, especially interfaces

= Fedora (interfaces) =

See http://fedora-commons.org/documentation/3.3/REST%20API.html

== Ingest ==

Normally we would aim to create items with SWORD, but we can also create by POSTing to /objects/new or /objects/{pid} (to create with a specific PID), with text/xml content

== RIF-CS updates ==

Can create (POST), read (GET) and update (PUT) RIF-CS datastreams at:
/objects/{pid}/datastreams/{dsID}

If we use the same name for all rif-cs datastreams (e.g. "rif-cs") then we can create an httpd proxy which proxies from {{{/rif-cs/{pid}}}} to {{{/objects/{pid}/datastreams/rif-cs}}} which will then let us treat the values of rif-cs keys as (relative) URIs, and provide a RESTful access layer to just the rif-cs.

== Notifications ==
Fedora uses Apache ActiveMQ for messaging.

We may want to use this as a way to listen for edits of the RIF-CS data in Fedora and keep a separate search index up to date.

ActiveMQ supports a number of protocols including a supposedly "RESTful" HTTP interface that would be useable from XProc.

A bogus aspect of it is that the GET method is neither safe nor idempotent. So in fact it's not a REST interface at all.

There's a related "AJAX" interface as well which appears to use HTTP POST:
