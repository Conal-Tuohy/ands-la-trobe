#summary Notes about Fedora, especially interfaces

Fedora uses Apache ActiveMQ for messaging.

We may want to use this as a way to listen for edits of the RIF-CS data in Fedora and keep a separate search index up to date.

ActiveMQ supports a number of protocols including a supposedly "RESTful" HTTP interface that would be useable from XProc.


http://activemq.apache.org/rest.html

A bogus aspect of it is that the GET method is neither safe nor idempotent. So in fact it's not a REST interface at all.

There's a related "AJAX" interface as well which appears to use HTTP POST:
