= Introduction =

A list of things to check when deploying or retesting this system.

== Result testing ==

=== Sample test package ===

Currently, a test deposit should contain the following:

 * A boss.xml file containing a response from the RLI booking system.
 * A corresponding dataset file (dset, vamas, itm/ita, etc).

=== local ingest (Sword/Fedora) ===

==== Sword ingest ====

By default (and if no mets.xml is present in the ingest package), Sword generates something similar to the following in the DC stream:

{{{
<oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd">
  <dc:title>Uploaded by the JISC funded SWORD project</dc:title>
  <dc:creator>fedoraAdmin</dc:creator>
  <dc:format>application/zip</dc:format>
  <dc:identifier>namespace:entryNumber/dc:identifier>
</oai_dc:dc>
}}}

Note that this data is not used by the CMSS system, but is used to generate the initial fox-ml record in Fedora. Note also that future additions (e.g METS files in ingest packages) may change this output and its usefulness.

==== Fedora ingest ====

Fedora's primary role in this system is simply that of an object database, with the addition of JMS's notificaiton system. Messages from JMS trigger crosswalks.

=== crosswalks ===

==== ingest-handler ====

This crosswalk performs the following roles:

 * Generate a handle (from hdl.handle.net) 
 * add 'handle' stream to the record

 * retrieve data from boss.xml 
 * convert it into 'dataset' format
 * add 'dataset' stream to the record

 * recognise file types (eg. .itm, .dset, .vms)
 * add appropriate tags so other crosswalks can handle these files

==== metadata-update-handler ====

This crosswalk performs the following roles:

 * generate and test RIF-CS output
 * send RIF-CS to ANDS metadata store
 * add 'rif-cs' stream to the record

 * convert rif-cs to OAI_DC 
 * replace existing DC stream

 * convert fox-ml to solr record
 * push solr record to solr indexer
 * add 'solr' stream to the record

==== vamas-update-handler ====

This crosswalk performs the following roles:

 * push vamas file to Java XML converter
 * add resulting 'vamas-xml' stream to the record

==== surfacelab-update-handler ====

This crosswalk performs the following roles:

 * push .itm file to Java XML converter
 * add resulting 'surfacelab-xml' stream to the record
