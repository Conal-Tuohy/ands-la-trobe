#summary Notes on stripping back data and expected results and outcomes

= Introduction =

A list of things to do and/or check when deploying or retesting this system.


== Fedora ==

Fedora stores data simultaneously in the relational and pairtree databases. Both of these need to be cleared in order to purge the system of records.

The fedora applicaion should not be running when the procedure is carried out if you don't want to see hundreds of null pointer exceptions in your servlet handler logs.

=== Database ===

Issuing the following sequence of commands from with the DBMS will purge the database of records:

{{{
use database fedora3;
truncate doFields;
truncate doRegistry;
truncate pidGen;
}}}

=== Disk ===

The following commands will purge the pairtree and resourceIndex.

{{{
cd $FEDORA_HOME/data
rm -rf /activemq-data/*
rm -rf /datastreamStore/*
rm -rf /resourceIndex/* 
}}}
