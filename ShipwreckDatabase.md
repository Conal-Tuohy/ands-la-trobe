FYI here is a basic search of the shipwreck database mentioned at the workshop: https://apps5a.ris.environment.gov.au/shipwreck/public/relic/relic.do?key=12


Interesting navigation between the wreck/vessel and objects, but the object descriptions are much briefer than ours. Also like the expandable views of each data subset.
