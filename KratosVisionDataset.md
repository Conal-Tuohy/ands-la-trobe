# Kratos "Vision" dataset files #

The "Vision" surface analysis software from [Kratos Analytical](http://surface.kratos.com/) uses the extension `.dset` to identify its dataset files.

These are not standard file formats; they are proprietary files which generally require the Vision software to read and write. There are also a couple of utility programs available to convert these files into other formats.

Files in this format may be identified using the internet media type `application/x-kratos-vision-dataset`.

The persistent URI http://hdl.handle.net/102.100.100/6973 (currently redirecting to this page) may be used as a formal identifier for the file format.
