# XProc #

Workflow in the DC19 is carried out by scripts written in the W3C's XML Pipeline Language [XProc](http://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/)

The XProc scripts are within the [xproc](http://code.google.com/p/ands-la-trobe/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fpipelines%2Fxproc) folder of the repository.

## XProc Documentation ##

  * [The language spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/)
  * [An online book (in draft stages)](http://xprocbook.com/book/book-1.html)
  * [Test suite](http://tests.xproc.org/testsuite/)

## Implementation ##

We are using [XML Calabash](http://xmlcalabash.com/) as our XProc interpreter. See the [Calabash](Calabash.md) page on this wiki for details of installation.
