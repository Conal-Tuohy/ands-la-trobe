		<h1>Fedora Update Handler</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>Fedora Update Handler is a Java application for receiving and acting on notifications of updates to a Fedora Commons repository.</p>
		<p>The Fedora Update Handler may be used to keep other information systems up to date with the latest information present in the Fedora repository. For instance, the updated content may be indexed in a discovery system or replicated into another repository. The updated content might be validated or checksummed, or cross-walked or otherwise transformed. For instance, a data stream might be cross-walked into another format and the resulting document written back to the Fedora object as another datastream.</p>
		<h2>How it works</h2>
		<p>When a datastream in the repository is changed, Fedora sends a message, in the form of an Atom document, to the Fedora Update Handler application. In turn, the Fedora Update Handler application executes an external program, and passes the Atom message to that program via its standard input stream. The Fedora Update Handler is therefore a bridge between JMS and arbitrary console applications.</p>
