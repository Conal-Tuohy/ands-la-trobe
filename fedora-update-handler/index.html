		<h1>Fedora Update Handler</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>Fedora Update Handler is a Java application for receiving and acting on notifications of updates to a Fedora Commons repository.</p>
		<p>The Fedora Update Handler may be used to keep other information systems up to date with the latest information present in the Fedora repository. For instance, the updated content may be indexed in a discovery system or replicated into another repository. The updated content might be validated or checksummed, or cross-walked or otherwise transformed. For instance, a data stream might be cross-walked into another format and the resulting document written back to the Fedora object as another datastream.</p>
		<h2>How it works</h2>
		<p>When a datastream in the repository is changed, Fedora sends a message, in the form of an Atom document, to the Fedora Update Handler application. In turn, the Fedora Update Handler application executes a user-specified external program, and passes the Atom message to that program via its standard input stream. The Fedora Update Handler is therefore a bridge between JMS and arbitrary console applications.</p>
		<h2>How to build the application</h2>
		<p>First you will need to have installed Java 1.5 or later, and Apache Ant. </p>
		<p>Check out the Fedora Update Handler source code from the Subversion repository:</p>
		<p><kbd>svn checkout http://ands-la-trobe.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/fedora-update-handler fedora-update-handler</kbd></p>
		<p>Navigate into the folder and invoke the Ant tool to build the application:</p>
		<p><kbd>cd fedora-update-handler</kbd></p>
		<p><kbd>ant</kbd></p>
		<p>Ant will read the <code>build.xml</code> file and output the application to <code>build/fedora-update-handler.jar</code></p>
		<h2>How to run the application</h2>
		<p>The application should be run on the same host as the Fedora service itself. </p>
		<p>You will need to enable Fedora's JMS service.</p>
		<p>You will need to copy the fedora-update-handler.jar into a folder along with all the jars in the <code>lib</code> folder.</p>
		<p>To run the application:</p>
		<p><kbd>java -jar fedora-update-handler.jar</kbd> <var>command-line to execute to handle message</var></p>
		<p>The fedora-update-handler application will connect to Fedora and subscribe to update notifications. When a notification message is received, the application will execute the specified command, and pass the notification message to it as the standard input stream.</p>
		<p>For instance, to forward the notifications by email, using the <var>email</var> program, you might enter the following command:</p>
		<p><kbd>java -jar fedora-update-handler.jar</kbd> <var>mail -s 'Fedora Update Notification' address@example.com</var></p>
