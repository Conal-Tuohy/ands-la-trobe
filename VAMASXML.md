The VAMAS-XML format is produced by a simple parser of files in the ISO 14976:1998 VAMAS data exchange format; a plain text, newline delimited format used in materials science.

VAMAS-XML is designed to make it easier to handle VAMAS files using modern XML-based tools, e.g. using XSLT to generate graphs, or perform metadata extraction for a data repository.

The VAMAS-XML element vocabulary is drawn simplistically from the ISO specification for the VAMAS exchange format. VAMAS-XML does not use XML attributes.

The vocabulary is currently only defined in [the Java source of the VAMAS Parser](http://code.google.com/p/ands-la-trobe/source/browse/trunk/dc19/VAMASParser/src/au/edu/latrobe/cmss/vamas/VAMASParser.java#151)
