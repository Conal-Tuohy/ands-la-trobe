Analysis: we will at a minimum provide export of tabular data. But need to integrate into other systems.

"I do most of my analysis in Access". Users want to be able to build ad-hoc queries for one-off kinds of analysis.

Heritage Victoria will require summaries by context, functional groups, etc. HV require Excel so this would require training in Excel pivot tables, etc. But AHAD could provide pre-built reports to meet those requirements.

Peter asks if the survey produced evidence of inter-site analysis. Apparently very little (but some), though people reported they were keen to be _able_ to do that.

Penny reports survey participants rated databases on the qualities of the vocabularies used in them.

NB avoid clash between workshops and the ASHA conference 17-19 Nov.
